			Hey there!
			&nbsp
			I'm Gabe and I develop plugins for RPG Maker MZ (and also for MV when on demand). I have been making several free plugins available under my Gabe MV/MZ brand and also providing support for Akea evolution (a line of very powerful battle plugins for MZ).
			&nbsp
			If you like my work, you might consider supporting me, either by making donations through itch.io, through the Patreon, or through the Catarse (if you're a Brazilian).
			&nbsp
			I'm also available for commissions, if you want to order something, just get in touch. My discord is: Gabe#9469
			&nbsp
			Check the complete documentation for all my plugins at GabeMZ.
